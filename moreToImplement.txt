- multi line comments
- comma operator (like in C)
- support for ternary
- Add error productions to handle each binary operator appearing without a left-hand operand. In other words, detect a binary operator appearing at the beginning of an expression. Report that as an error, but also parse and discard a right-hand operand with the appropriate precedence.
-The REPL no longer supports entering a single expression and automatically printing its result value. Thatâ€™s a drag. Add support to the REPL to let users type in both statements and expressions. If they enter a statement, execute it. If they enter an expression, evaluate it and display the result value.
-increment and decrement operators
-break and continue statements
